## The Objective
Rebuild Dr. Sofa’s website without having to migrate their large database of indexed pages and posts.

## Approach
We decided to build Dr. Sofa a brand-new, custom WordPress theme; this eliminated the need to migrate the current WordPress database.

## Result
After five weeks of designing, developing, and migration, Dr. Sofa’s new website was launched without a hitch.

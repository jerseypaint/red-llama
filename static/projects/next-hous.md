## Objective
Turn an unfinished design and demo into a fully-functional web application.

## Approach
We decided on Laravel and Vue.js as the app’s core technologies due to our team’s familiarity with them.

## Result
Next Hous is now a live application that includes user accounts, multi-point matchmaking, messaging, and payment processing.

## Objective
Health Unchained publishes their podcast through a number of publishers, including Soundcloud and Spotify, and didnâ€™t want to add any more. It was essential for the new website to draw episodes from their current publishers instead of being dependent on uploads.

## Approach
Our first task was to find an API that was easy to use and was reliable. Soundcloud recently closed their API to new applicants, so Spotify was the next best choice.

## Result
In combination with Gatsby, Contenful, and Axios, we developed a dynamic website that is easy for Health Unchained to update and maintain.

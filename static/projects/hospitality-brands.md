## Objective
Create an easy user experience and a clean way to update content. Instead of logging into an admin panel. Red Llama built a system where the editor can log in and just edit on the user interface, making the new system very easy to use. 

## Approach
The system was built in Node.js (backend) and Vue.js (frontend). One of the issues on their last web application was performance and organization of products. So at RLG, we used mongodb to deliver lightning speed search results. 

## Result
Each group of products: glassware, unbreakable drinkware, barware, and creative table have their own sections of the database and are only filtered on their pages. So if someone was searching for a plate in creative table section it would appear but wouldnâ€™t appear in barware for example. This made the application easy to handle and update on the backend as an engineer and also as an user.

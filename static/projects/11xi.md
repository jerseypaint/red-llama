## Objective
Build an integrated online catalog and admin portal for logging, tracking, and displaying cannabis products produced by 11XI’s farms.

## Approach
11XI was transitioning to a new brand image. They wanted a new clean and minimalistic vibe that would echo, “Oregon” with a hint of luxury. After researching the local area and other coastal parts of Oregon, we decided to gear the brand around a vibrant and free lifestyle. The web application was built in Node.js (backend) and Vue.js (frontend).

## Result
In addition to rebranding, building their sales team, marketing direction, and website - we also created a custom Customer Relationship Management system (CRM) for 11XI. The CRM included four user roles: 
- **Investor**: Can view all the data provided by farmers, view inventory, add/delete users, and view dispensary sales)
- **Sales Rep**: Can view farm, inventory, and dispensary data
- **Farmer**: Can update and view farm inventory
- **Dispensary**: Can communicate with sales representatives, request samples that trigger an alert to both sales reps and farmers.

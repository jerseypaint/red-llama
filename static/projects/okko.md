## Objective
One of our most recent projects for Okko was the development of a custom cart drawer plugin. They wanted the ability to recommend related products to online shoppers based on the items they added to their cart.

## Approach
We leveraged Shopify’s Product API, Liquid templating, Handlebars.js and AJAX to build a cart that updates and upsells in real time.

## Result
When a user ads an item to their cart, the cart automatically suggests a related product in the same size and color as the item in the cart.
